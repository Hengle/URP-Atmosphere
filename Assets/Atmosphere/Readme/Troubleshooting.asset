    text: "There are numerous reasons why Volumetric Atmospheres might not be being
      displayed in your scene, and this section will go over the most common points
      of failure or oversight.\n\n<i>Missing Render Feature:</i>\nMake sure that
      the active URP Renderer has the Atmosphere Render Feature added to its list
      of render features. If you have confirmed the render feature is added, check
      if the Renderer it is on is the one currently active in your quality settings.
      If not, either add it to your active Renderer, or change your quality settings
      to use the Renderer with the feature.\n\n<i>Invalid Profile Settings:</i>\nThe
      settings on the Atmosphere Effect's Atmosphere Profile may be causing the atmosphere
      to not appear at all. If you do not know which one of the values may be causing
      the problem, compare them with the default profile values on a new profile.\nThe
      most common problem value is the Rayleigh and Mie scattering values. The best
      way to quickly check if the values are in the proper range is to use the Color
      Picker to inspect the scattering values as a color. If it very dark or black,
      it may not display at all.\n\n<i>Invalid Cutoff Depth:</i> \nYour atmosphere
      might not be displaying because the cutoff depth is too high or negative. If
      this is the issue, it means the atmosphere is cut off before it can render.
      Test if setting the cutoff depth value to 0 displays the atmosphere.\n\n<i>Planet
      is too Small:</i> Atmospheres can commonly encounter issues with very small
      planet values. Make sure all other values related to scale are in a sensible
      range relative to the planet's size.\n\n<i>Active Camera does not have Post-Processing
      enabled:</i>\nAtmospheres comply with camera Post-Processing settings, and
      will disable/enable themselves depending on whether or not the camera has Post-Processing
      enabled. Validate that your game or scene camera has Post-Processing enabled."

    heading: Atmosphere has Flickery or Strange Values Going Towards Planet Center.
    text: Adjust the Cutoff Depth value to be a reasonable distance from the surface
      of the planet. The depth dictates from how far into the planet the effect cuts
      off at. You can edit the depth when selecting an Atmosphere Effect in the scene
      with the red sphere handle. Make sure it is slightly smaller than the yellow
      sphere handle.
