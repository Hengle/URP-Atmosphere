    heading: Effect Complexity
    text: Depending on the amount of effects present on screen at any given time
      and the effect settings, Atmospheres may take up a considerable amount of rendering
      time and memory. Each active Atmosphere Effect has to manage an internal texture
      for baking, which while not overly big, can build up if multiple effects are
      being used. The effect also makes use of compute shaders, loops and transcendential
      math functions in shaders, so make sure to check platform support and take
      it into consideration on lower-end hardware.

    heading: Optimizing Atmospheres
    text: 'If atmospheres are heavily impacting your performance, a few steps can
      be taken to reduce the amount of resources they use.


      By minimizing
      the amount of Atmosphere Effects <i>visible</i> at any given time, performance
      can be improved.


      The more expensive settings in the Atmosphere Profile
      can also be tweaked to improve performance.

      Reducing the InScatterPoints
      value will have the most drastic effect on rendering times but will impact
      visual quality and banding.

      Reducing LUTSize and OpticalDepthPoints
      will improve memory usage and baking time on startup.

      Using a Directional
      sun in the Atmosphere Effect will also reduce the amount of computations the
      shader will have to do.'
